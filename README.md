Main inspiration behind this code and lots of credit to KGP Talkie (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38Kxtf52EcI)

This tool allows you to live monitor your GPU performance at any desired refresh rate. You can run this notebook on any kernel at the same time as you are using any IDE to train a neural network. You should be using a CUDA GPU for yout machine learning task, otherwise this monitoring tool would be useless. 

## Requirements:
GPUtil, matplotlib
